I took some code from [here](https://kaggle.com/code/aisuko/llama-in-pytorch)
and the source repos for the papers referenced in the LLaMA paper.

Wouldn't it be crazy if I were able to reproduce the results from scratch, without seeing any code?
That would be really insane for the scientific community since reproducibility is such a big issue, but unfortunately
I feel like some details were not explained in depth in the papers.
